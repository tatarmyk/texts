DREAMS - OMENS - SUBCONSCIOUS - EMOTIONS
I mean, I already have questions on 3 of this and they are pretty similar. 

RELATIONSHIP

PEOPLE

INTIMACY
NIGHT
Why people feel more connected and easy-going in the night?
What is the differences in feeling between day and night for you?
When is it easier to communicate with people during the day or at night?

COMFORT
What is a comfortable person?
Does comfort lead to degradation?
If we feel good when uncomfortable (challenging ourselves) does it become new comfort?
Then if it becomes a new comfort does it mean we don't challenge ourselves anymore?

DISCIPLINE
Freedom or limitations?
At some point, discipline brings freedom, because you have enough willpower to do what you really want to.
On the other hand it can create borders driving you away from instincts and subconcious.

WEIRD THINGS <-> NORMALIZED

FILTER <-> CLOSE-MINDED <-> INFORMATIONAL GARBAGE
# very similar to fluid identity question

SAMURAI COWBOYS and PIRATES
why are they so cool? and who would you be?

WA(O)NDERING
To explore. Is it our ultimate goal as human beings?

CURIOSITY

WHO <-> WHY <-> WHERE <-> WHAT <-> WHEN 
- are you
- do you care about (smt)
- (sth) influences you
- can you really trust (somebody/anybody)

Untill I'm alive it's never too late.

Yes, u see our world is probably greatly shifted from the one we can see in the "The Alchemist". Because as for me, I think it's never too late to ralise
your destiny. Even if you're old and went away from it, you see, you're still alive and that's only what means. I mean, I do understand why boy didn't want to tell
the bakers his destiny. But if I was the baker, I would be greatful to know my destiny as a sherped, even if I'm already old. If I'm still alive, I can do it.
Okay, maybe it's not the world that is changed, but just me more relating to the boy, which asks his heart never stop talking.

Nice, any time when I feel like I am out of questions, some new appear..
